AI-Color-Generator-App

This is a Jupyter notebook project for generating color palettes based on text prompts using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

Getting Started

To get started, you will need to do the following:

Install Jupyter Notebook and the necessary dependencies.
Set up an OpenAI API key and save it in a .env file.
Encrypt the .env file before uploading it to Github.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Start Jupyter Notebook and open the color-palette-generator.ipynb file.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

Jupyter Notebook (version 6.0 or later)
Python (version 3.7 or later)
The following Python libraries: openai, python-dotenv

Installing

To install Jupyter Notebook and the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

pip install jupyter
pip install openai python-dotenv

Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

Set your OpenAI API key in a .env file in the project directory.
Start Jupyter Notebook by running the command jupyter notebook in the project directory.
Open the color-palette-generator.ipynb file.
Run the cells in the notebook to generate color palettes based on text prompts.

Security

To keep your API key and other sensitive information secure, you should:

Store your API key in a .env file.

Exclude the .env file from version control by adding it to your .gitignore file.
Encrypt the contents of the .env file before uploading it to Github.
Share the encryption keys only with those who need access to the file.

Acknowledgments
